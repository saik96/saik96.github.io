I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** in **CEA Paris-Saclay** currently working on fluid dynamics and nonlinear systems.  
This site is a collection of my work, talks, and notes.

Current research interests
---

- Numerical search for finite time singularities in hydrodynamical partial differential equations(PDEs)
and magneto-hydrodynamical equations: using DNS and Log-Lattice models, in complex-space and
complex-time.
- Thermalization and development of ‘tygers’ in Galerkin-truncated hydrodynamical PDEs.
- Modification of spectral methods for problems with shocks and other forms of discontinuities.
