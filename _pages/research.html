  <p class="research-summary">
    We develop a Fourier-Chebyshev pseudospectral direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine a potentially singular solution of the radially bounded, three-dimensional (3D), axisymmetric Euler equations [G. Luo and T.Y. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 12968 (2014)]. We demonstrate that (a) the time of singularity is preceded, in any spectrally truncated DNS, by the formation of oscillatory structures called tygers, first investigated in the one-dimensional (1D) Burgers and two-dimensional (2D) Euler equations; (b) the analyticity-strip method can be generalized to obtain an estimate for the (potential) singularity time.
