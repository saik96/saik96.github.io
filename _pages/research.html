  <p class="research-summary">
    We develop a Fourier-Chebyshev pseudospectral direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine a potentially singular solution of the radially bounded, three-dimensional (3D), axisymmetric Euler equations [G. Luo and T.Y. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 12968 (2014)]. We demonstrate that (a) the time of singularity is preceded, in any spectrally truncated DNS, by the formation of oscillatory structures called tygers, first investigated in the one-dimensional (1D) Burgers and two-dimensional (2D) Euler equations; (b) the analyticity-strip method can be generalized to obtain an estimate for the (potential) singularity time.

    Novel spectral methods for shock capturing and the removal of tygers in computational
    fluid dynamics
  </h3>

  <p class="research-summary">
    Spectral methods yield numerical solutions of the Galerkin-truncated versions of nonlinear partial dif-
    ferential equations (PDEs) involved especially in fluid dynamics. In the presence of discontinuities, such
    as shocks, spectral approximations develop Gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity. This causes the
    numerical solution to deviate quickly from the true solution. For spectral approximations of the inviscid
    Burgers equation in one-dimension (1D), nonlinear wave resonances lead to the formation of localised
    oscillatory structures called tygers in well-resolved areas of the flow, far from the shock. Recently, the
    author of Besse(2024, submitted) has proposed novel spectral relaxation (SR) and spectral purging
    (SP) schemes for the removal of tygers and Gibbs oscillations in spectral approximations of nonlinear
    conservation laws.

  <p class="research-summary">
    For the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, it is shown in Besse(2024, submitted) that
    the novel SR and SP approximations of the solution converge strongly in L
    2 norm to the entropic
    weak solution, under an appropriate choice of kernels and related parameters. In this work, we carry
    out a detailed numerical investigation of SR and SP schemes when applied to the 1D inviscid Burgers
    equation and report the efficiency of shock capture and the removal of tygers. We then extend our
    study to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws — such as the 2x2 system of the shallow
    water equations and the standard 3x3 system of 1D compressible Euler equations. For the latter, we
    generalise the implementation of SR methods to non-periodic problems using Chebyshev polynomials.

  <p class="research-summary">
    We then turn to singular flow in the 1D wall approximation of the 3D-axisymmetric wall-bounded
    incompressible Euler equation [G. Luo and T.Y. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 12968 (2014)].
    Here, in order to determine the blowup time of the solution, we compare the decay of the width of the
    analyticity strip, obtained from the pure pseudospectral method (PPS), with the improved estimate
    obtained using the novel spectral relaxation scheme.
