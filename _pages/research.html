    Insights from a pseudospectral study of a potentially singular solution of the three-dimensional axisymmetric incompressible Euler equation

  <p class="research-summary">
    We develop a Fourier-Chebyshev pseudospectral direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine a potentially singular solution of the radially bounded, three-dimensional (3D), axisymmetric Euler equations [G. Luo and T.Y. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 12968 (2014)]. We demonstrate that (a) the time of singularity is preceded, in any spectrally truncated DNS, by the formation of oscillatory structures called tygers, first investigated in the one-dimensional (1D) Burgers and two-dimensional (2D) Euler equations; (b) the analyticity-strip method can be generalized to obtain an estimate for the (potential) singularity time.

    Novel spectral methods for shock capturing and the removal of tygers in computational
    fluid dynamics
  </h3>

  <p class="research-authors">
    Published with Nicolas Besse and Rahul Pandit.
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    Spectral methods yield numerical solutions of the Galerkin-truncated versions of nonlinear partial dif-
    ferential equations (PDEs) involved especially in fluid dynamics. In the presence of discontinuities, such
    as shocks, spectral approximations develop Gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity. This causes the
    numerical solution to deviate quickly from the true solution. For spectral approximations of the inviscid
    Burgers equation in one-dimension (1D), nonlinear wave resonances lead to the formation of localised
    oscillatory structures called tygers in well-resolved areas of the flow, far from the shock. Recently, the
    author of Besse(2024, submitted) has proposed novel spectral relaxation (SR) and spectral purging
    (SP) schemes for the removal of tygers and Gibbs oscillations in spectral approximations of nonlinear
    conservation laws.
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    For the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, it is shown in Besse(2024, submitted) that
    the novel SR and SP approximations of the solution converge strongly in L
    2 norm to the entropic
    weak solution, under an appropriate choice of kernels and related parameters. In this work, we carry
    out a detailed numerical investigation of SR and SP schemes when applied to the 1D inviscid Burgers
    equation and report the efficiency of shock capture and the removal of tygers. We then extend our
    study to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws — such as the 2x2 system of the shallow
    water equations and the standard 3x3 system of 1D compressible Euler equations. For the latter, we
    generalise the implementation of SR methods to non-periodic problems using Chebyshev polynomials.
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    We then turn to singular flow in the 1D wall approximation of the 3D-axisymmetric wall-bounded
    incompressible Euler equation [G. Luo and T.Y. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 12968 (2014)].
    Here, in order to determine the blowup time of the solution, we compare the decay of the width of the
    analyticity strip, obtained from the pure pseudospectral method (PPS), with the improved estimate
    obtained using the novel spectral relaxation scheme.

    Early time resonances in the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations and their
    one-dimensional wall approximation
  </h3>

  <p class="research-authors">
    Published with Rahul Pandit
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    We investigate the potentially singular solutions of the three-dimensional(3D) axisymmetric Euler equa-
    tions(see Luo et al.(2014)) using asymptotic time-Taylor series methods for the velocity and vorticity
    fields. We find the analogue of the “eye of the tyger” reported in the 1D inviscid Burgers equations
    by Rampf et al.(2022) and discuss them here. The singularities that lead to the time- counterparts of
    the “tygers” that we report in our earlier pseudospectral studies of these models, are arranged in the
    complex temporal domain in the shape of an eye centered about the origin for the potentially singu-
    lar initial conditions. We also study the case of the simplified 1D Hilbert model that can be used to
    approximate the axisymmetric Euler flow at the wall.

    Ideal incompressible axisymmetric MHD: Uncovering finite-time singularities
  </h3>

  <p class="research-authors">
    Submitted with Rahul Pandit
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    We investigate the 3D incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamic(IMHD) equations for the develop-
    ment of potential singularities, using the background velocity generated by the initial condition of Luo
    et al.(2014) to generate a potentially singular velocity field. In particular, we employ our spectral DNS
    to carry out analogous measurements of the width of the analyticity strip, which is now defined for the
    magnetic and kinetic fields, respectively as discussed in the work of Brachet et al.(2013).

    Lagrangian studies of singularities in the 1D Hou-Luo model
  </h3>

  <p class="research-authors">
    Ongoing with Cornelius Rampf
  </p>

  <p class="research-summary">
    We construct a Lagrangian theory for the 1D Hou–Luo (HL) model which is the wall-approximation of
    the 3D-axisymmetric Euler equation. We derive the Lagrangian time-Taylor coefficients using recursion
    relations and perform asymptotic analysis of the coefficients to deduce the locations of the singularities.
    We find that we are able to extend the Eulerian results of Kolluru et al. (2024) and that the singularities
    are arranged in the shape of an eye about the origin in the complex plane. Using the Lagrangian theory,
    we can find the time at which the finite-time singularity occurs for this 1D model.
